## ðŸ’« About me
Hi, my name is Thom Zwagers (Netherlands, 1976). I'm a meteorologist and started programming in BASIC at the age of 9 on a ZX81. Nearly 40 years and several computers/programming languages later, I'm mostly programming for fun, but also to make my work in the weather room easier.

Besides programming, I love running, visiting English football matches, meteorology, old computers and comics (not American comics with superheroes).
